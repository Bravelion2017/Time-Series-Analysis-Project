TO RUN THE .py FILE, GET THE DATASET FROM 
https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/Metro+Interstate+Traffic+Volume 
ALSO ADD THE MYTOOLS.PY TO SAME PATH OF THE .py FILE

THE .ipynb FILE IS FOR BIDERCTIONAL LSTM APPROACH. THIS NOTEBOOK FILE WAS EXECUTED ON GOOGLE COLAB
FOR GPU ASSISTANCE.
BEFORE RUNNING THE .ipynb CHANGE THE abspath_curr TO YOUR PATH, THEN NAVIGATE TO YOUR
DOWNLOADED DATASET.

NOTE: THE split_seq IN LSTM SPLITS THE DATA EVERY 24 STEPS WITH 1 STEP AHEAD. THIS IS DONE TO
CAPTURE THE SEASONALITY AS SEEN IN THE PEAKS OF EVERY 24 LAGS ON THE ACF PLOT.
